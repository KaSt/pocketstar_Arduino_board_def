Hola all!

Long time ago, not so long actually, got myself a Pocketstar. A nice little  miniature game console.
https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/zepsch/pocketstar-play-retro-games-on-your-keychain

Yet, I was now missing the required files to do any development for it.

Thanks to Jan Willem Verzijden (https://github.com/crostine) I managed to collect all the required files.

This Repo is here to make sure these files available to anyone.

The zepsch directory is where the actual board definition files are. This needs to be placed in your "Arduino15/packages" folder. Its location actually dependes on your OS. I bet if you're here you know how to find the folder.
The package_zepsch_index.json file needs to go to the root of the Arduino15 folder.

Remember to install the Pocketstar lib as well: https://github.com/crostine/PocketStarLibrary

There, I cam now compile my Pocketstar games!

Thanks!
